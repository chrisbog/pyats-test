# pyats-test example

## Description
This module is a very simple testing application to show of the pyats-test(genie) libraries.

## Details
In this example, we are using the testbed.yaml.example file to create the testbed.   This testbed file describes all
the devices in the test lab.    It also includes names and login credentials for each device.

The code itself will log into each device and run a parser for a few show commands.

When you execute this code, please change the testbed.yaml.example to testbed.yaml.
